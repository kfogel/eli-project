“It is interesting to see how this architectural resource [sound] which runs counter to any utilitarian model of the city, shifts things in a new direction: the space becomes one of social experimentation. And the syncopated movement of human beings replaces any the predetermined order;” - Federica Bueti, from Nothing to see in the mirror of the perpetual movement of sound

SOUND and ACOUSTICS are immersive, multidimensional, subconscious, and messy. (0)
~
How does the interaction between technology and sound and immense impacts on our existence and society, especially in the urban fabric? 
~
This thesis seeks to observe sound on a technical level and experiment with the capabilities that modern tools and long-standing methods of acoustic manipulation allow to understand how sonic experimentation can be a radical method for social connection.

These spaces are for prayer, and expansive experience; large: one well known and long standing sonic architecture is that of the cathedral: characterized by being big and being made of stone with high reverberation times and amplification.

The advent of more advanced electrical sound technology with full range capabilities (<=Twenty hz - Twenty khz+) as well as more advanced processing in the Sixties and Seventies gave rise to a completely new way to experiment with sound: the ability to translate the manipulation of electricity to the manipulation of sound in very complex ways, and this is what this project is interested in.
~
Harnessing the physical and electrical augmentation of sound is the ability to quickly create entire sonic atmospheres emulating indoor or outdoor space, and tear them down in an instant.

Ever since the creation of the electric loudspeaker in relation to the telephone, it was about the reproduction of voice. And ever since, we are trying to get better and better at producing and curating the VOICE. The voice is very compelling to us; the desire for it to enter our brains and bodies unadulterated; to hear the origin perfectly, and hear it together at the same time. The voice can expand beyond the human voice, it can be a delicate instrumental performance, and even the output of an analog synthesizer.
~
Interested in the nuances of the fabled “perfect sound” and realities of audio reproduction, this thesis explores the depths of audio and acoustical engineering, and how out of experimentation arises an intimate relationship between sound and listener amidst the higher dimensional space that sound inhabits.

THE EXPERIMENT:
~
What has been created is a multi-part audio system that focuses on two primary things: the production of very low frequencies to explore resonance, and the disassembly and fermentation of the standard loudspeaker for experimentation while maintaining fidelity.

What you just experienced is the product of interventions across the audio spectrum
~
This thesis is about the construction of this sound space, but also to propose one possible architectural intervention into the space in the spirit of experimentation.
~
As you have now experienced, the room can become a maze of undulating, transitory sonic barriers, and these can only be revealed to us one thin slice at a time. Proposed is one possible reaction to this phenomenon: a specifically selected area at either a high acoustic energy or low acoustic energy level. (5)
